# Simplex

A not optimized simple solution for the Simplex-Algorithm.
I've used the Apache.Math-Library to fancy it up and use Matrices and Vectors instead of Arrays.

It looks a little bit more Math-related code that way, but in the end Arrays would have been faster.

Feel free to use this code as you like.
